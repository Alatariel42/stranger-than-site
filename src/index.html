    <p>A director with a reputation for re-staging classics takes on Ionescoâ€™s Rhinoceros making a crucial change to reflect current societal fears. A neophyte lands the role of the protagonist. Another cast member begins to wonder about his stake in this play. As rehearsals progress and the new Rhino emerges, the tension between cast and the play, especially our mysterious neophyte, brings the play to a startling conclusion about our recent past.</p>
